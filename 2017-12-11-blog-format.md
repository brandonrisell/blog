Working on a new structure for my writing. I currently have a bunch of random posts and notes buried in wordpress databases or random gitub repo starts. I'm going to organize my writing into github repos that are named according to their purpose. This way, my writing will remain easily accessible and separate from where it's being displayed. I can then include the repos as submodules within my blog, and any other writing sites I build(let's be real, I'm going to have a new site or somesuch thing every couple of months).

I currently have a `notes` repo and a `blog` repo. Notes already has some. I need to dig up other notes of mine and add them as well.

Blog will be more journal style, things that I'm thinking and learning and working through.

If I get into any kind of writing habit, I could see myself having a `articles` and `fiction` repos as well. We'll see what happens though. I do rather enjoy writing to myself though, even though I find myself reading these several years later and wondering why I never kept up with it, haha.
